            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/Àà…ëÀêbd…ôl k…ôÀàl…ëÀêm/ ‚ìò; 15 October 1931 ‚Äì 27 July 2015) was an
            Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He
            was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
            the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
            involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came
            to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
            vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
            India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
            pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
            Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother
            Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
            forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four
            brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
            landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found
            in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
            business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka,
            as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to
            the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
            the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As
            a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.

            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
            Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
            Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
            unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
            Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S.
            Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).
