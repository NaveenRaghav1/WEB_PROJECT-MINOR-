            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
            Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
            Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
            unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
            Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S.
            Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).
